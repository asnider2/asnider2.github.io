  <h1>About Me</h1>
  <p>I originally arrived at Brown with the mindset that I would concentrate in History or English. I thought that these paths were the only way to secure my entry into law school. I did not have a particular interest in either of these studies, but I was under the impression that I needed to conform to a certain path. When choosing my classes for the last few semesters, my advisor recommended courses outside of the subjects I thought I needed to primarily study. I explored multiple classes in different departments outside of the humanities. In taking a class in the sociology department, I confirmed my interest in the law. While exploring classes in the English department, I found myself stagnant intellectually. While those classes were interesting, I did not feel as if I was learning. I felt as if I was simply reinforcing what I have been cultivating my entire life. While that is an important concept in the pursuit of education, I did not feel fulfilled.
    In exploring the more science and math-based courses, I felt challenged, but because I enjoyed the content, I did not feel frustrated. I realized that I should differentiate what I thought I needed to take and what I wanted to take. Before coming to college, I did not have the opportunity to explore the subject of Economics. Because of this barrier, I did not consider careers in this area. After taking a few courses in the department, I have developed an interest in Economics and want to continue to involve myself in the study.
    As for Computer Science, I, fortunately, had opportunities to explore this area before. I originally worked in marketing and learned Website design on the job. I learned HTML and CSS and gained an introduction to front-end web development. I enjoyed this work, but I did think I should pursue further studies as I was persistent to go into Law.
     While I still plan on attending Law School, I changed the focus of my studies. I do not have to choose humanities or science-based classes. I plan on enjoying my time studying economics and computer science while also pursuing my goal. I now aspire to explore the legal area of technology law or technology-based businesses. In all, I chose to declare Computer Science-Economics so I could pursue my interests and gather a basis for my future career.
    By taking classes in different departments, I have explored the different aspects of a liberal education. I have studied the past through my sociology course. I have developed a facility with symbolic languages through music. I also embraced diversity through learning about Mass Incarceration and Mande culture. Through my selection of classes I have explored the facets of liberal education, but I have done the same through my extracurricular activities.
    To improve my writing skills, I have taken courses outside of English. While I have proficient skills in interpreting literary texts, my level of comprehension of different kinds of texts is not at the same level. By taking classes outside of my comfort zone, I have been able to gain a wider breadth of knowledge. I plan to work on these skills by strengthening my understanding of the texts provided in my concentration. These texts are outside the realm of what I am used to, and as I take more classes, my writing skills will improve.
